# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori (Stress Dataset)

This project applies the Apriori algorithm to the Stress Dataset to uncover hidden patterns and frequent item associations. The workflow includes preprocessing, converting data to transactional format, generating frequent itemsets, and extracting association rules using support, confidence, and lift.

## Features
- Dataset preprocessing and transformation
- Frequent itemset mining with Apriori
- Association rule generation
- Filtering and evaluation using lift, confidence, and support

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- mlxtend
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional visualizations)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
```

pip install pandas mlxtend numpy matplotlib seaborn

```
2. Run the provided notebook: `Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm on Stress Dataset.ipynb`

## Result
The notebook outputs itemsets, association rules, and key insights to understand stress-related behavior patterns.

## Dataset
Public Stress Dataset (used for educational analysis only).
